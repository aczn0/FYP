# Final Year Project

This repository contains the code for my Final Year Project: Playing Tetris Optimally with Artificial Intelligence.

The project in this repository is broken due to improper importing of the files - thus this repository is for archival purposes only.

## Running the program
To run the program you must have at least .NET 8.

To open the program first navigate to the products folder in the project repository, then open the Game.exe file.

Open opening the Game.exe file you will see the Main menu. 
You can select either to Train Q Learning Agent or Train SARSA agent.

Upon selecting one of these you will be redirected to watch the agent play the game.

To navigate to the other agent, you must close and re-enter the program then select the other algorithm.

## Reports

The Final report is located in the documents folder.

The demonstration video is located under the demonstration folder in the report.
